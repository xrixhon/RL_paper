\section*{INTRODUCTION}
% General introduction on needing model to support decision makers and uncertainties in Pathway Optimisation
To help decision makers in paving the way of the energy transition and setting investment plans to meet the climate targets, \gls*{ESOM} explore possibilities the decision makers rely models to invest this transition pathway


% Usually what is done (myopic and prescribed trajectory) and what is missing/drawbacks

% What we propose methodologically (with reference to the figure)





On top of dealing with these uncertainties, the reality of decision-makers leads to a limited foresight into the future \cite{poncelet2016myopic}. In a perfect foresight approach, decision-makers would be able to, from now on, see the ``finish-line of the transition'' in 2050 and accordingly make the planning decisions once and for all. On the contrary, they uncover the realisation of these uncertainties step-by-step, in a ``myopic'' way, and progressively act on them to, hopefully, meet the set target to reduce the anthropogenic \gls*{GHG}. In the objective to respect an overall \ce{CO2} budget rather than to follow a prescribed \ce{CO2} emissions trajectory, there is a need for a framework to explore these multiple transition pathways and provide insight into intermediate milestones not to miss. On top of the ``what to do?'', this framework would aim at helping the policymakers to answer the  question ``how to do it?''.

Due to the increasing complexity of the systems and the integration of uncertainties, the last decades have seen the emergence of publications where \gls*{RL} is applied to energy systems \cite{cao2020reinforcement,perera2021applications}. In their respective reviews, \citet{cao2020reinforcement} and \citet{perera2021applications} highlighted groups of problems addressed with \gls*{RL} in the research field of energy systems: building energy management system (BEMS), optimisation of dispatch and operational control closely linked with the energy market and the optimal power flow problem in the grid, micro-grid management, electro-mobility or even demand-side management or optimal control of energy system devices like maximum power point tracking (MPPT) of wind turbines and \gls*{PV} panels.  

In this paper, we propose a novel method based on the application of \gls*{RL} to a new kind of energy system problem: the optimisation of the transition pathway of a whole-energy system. In this sense, the objective is to optimise a policy to support this transition in myopic conditions and subject to uncertainties and a \ce{CO2} budget rather than a prescribed \gls*{GHG} emissions trajectory (see Figure \ref{fig:Schematics_RL}). This method highlights the importance of taking short-term actions and points out the no-go zones where succeeding the energy transition is very unlikely.

Even though the following messages result from studies on Belgium, the trends can be transposed to other countries with a high demand and low renewable potentials such as the Netherlands or Germany \cite{thiran2024exploring,sun2024indispensable}. After showing the convergence of the learning process, intermediate milestones and effective energy policies are pointed out.

\section*{RESULTS}

\subsection*{Reward and success}
\label{subsec:RL:learning:rew_succ}

The learning phase has been split into batches of 500 steps, \ie 500 sequences of state-action-reward-new state. At the end of each batch, the up-to-date policy, \ie the \gls*{NN}, is saved. This way, we can assess the progress in the learning process and its convergence (see Figure \ref{fig:reward_success}).  The mean reward increases rapidly at the beginning of the learning process before reaching a plateau where the optimisation of the policy becomes more marginal.  As these successes indirectly drive the agent's optimisation, it shows that the reward function (see Figure \ref{fig:Reward}) leads towards more and more successes. However, given the wide range of uncertainty of some parameters and the agent's levers of action, this success rate stays limited at the end of the learning process. In other words, there are conditions where it is impossible for the agent to succeed the transition.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]

\caption{Mean reward and success rate of the different learning batches. The stabilisation of the reward curve shows a convergence of the learning process from the agent's point of view. The evolution of the success rate also shows that the reward function aims at more and more successful transitions.}
\label{fig:reward_success}
\end{figure}

\newpage
When assessing the distributions of the values of reward in the failure and success cases, one notices a range where these distributions overlap (see left-hand side of Figure \ref{fig:reward_status}). This area corresponds to either transitions that exceed the \ce{CO2} budget in 2050 but are cheaper than the total transition cost of reference (see Section \ref{sec:RL:act_states_rew}) or successful transitions that are more expensive. Besides this overlap, we observe that successes account for the majority of the cases with higher rewards. This is another indication that the reward function is appropriate in this exploration of successful transition pathways. More indirectly, in case of applying this methodology to another case study, this substantiates that the weights between emissions and cost defined in Section \ref{subsec:RL:act_states_rew:rew} could be used as an initial step and fine-tuned afterwards.

Considering the end of the time window where the \ce{CO2} budget is exceeded, the right-hand side of Figure \ref{fig:reward_status} shows that 2040 is the ``tipping year'' for the agent. Beyond this point, through this learning process, the chances to succeed the transition were 38\%. In other words, near-term (2025-2030) actions are necessary to hope to succeed the transition.

\caption{Reward distribution between successes and failures. Graph on the right-hand side details at the end of which time window the failure occurred. The ``tipping year'' is 2040 as failing the transition by 2040 represents 57\% of all the failures. Beyond this point, through this learning process, succeeding the transition represents 38\% of the episodes. }
\label{fig:reward_status}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{States}
\label{subsec:RL:learning:states}

The first two dimensions of the state space are the cumulative emissions and costs. They drive the value of the reward and, consequently, the optimisation of the agent's policy. Per definition, the threshold of 1.2\,Gt$_{\ce{CO2},\text{eq}}$ splits the episodes reaching 2050 into successes and failures (see Figure \ref{fig:Cum_gwp_cost}). Since infeasible cases or those that overshoot the \ce{CO2} budget are discarded before 2050 (see Section \ref{subsec:RL:act_states_rew:rew}), the number of attempts that reach further steps in the transition progressively decreases. Consequently, the share of successful transitions compared to failures progressively increases with time. 

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Cum_gwp_cost_3.pdf}
\caption{Exploration of the state space over the learning process: distribution of occurrence of cumulative emissions (left) and costs (right). The number of remaining attempts decreases with time since the infeasible problems and the solutions overshooting the \ce{CO2} budget are discarded prematurely, \ie before 2050. Besides infeasible problems, distributions labelled as ``Failure'' represent the attempts that overshot the \ce{CO2} budget by 2050 at the latest. The majority of successful transitions have cumulative emissions much lower than the \ce{CO2} budget and are cheaper than the REF case. }
\label{fig:Cum_gwp_cost}
\end{figure}

In the successful transitions, the median cumulative emissions, $\text{P}_{50}$, are about 0.9\,Gt$_{\ce{CO2},\text{eq}}$. Reaching cumulative emissions significantly lower than the \ce{CO2} budget is possible thanks to efforts made at earlier stages of the transition and the potential to install \gls*{SMR} later on. Considering the failures in 2050, half of these episodes ended up with cumulative emissions lower or equal to 1.4\,Gt$_{\ce{CO2},\text{eq}}$. As illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:reward_status}, 2040 is identified as the tipping year. Where 98\% of the failures were below the \ce{CO2} budget in 2035, only 37\% passed this threshold in 2040. This reminds the importance of near-term, 2025-2030, actions to hope for a successful transition.

Given the reward function (see Figure \ref{fig:Reward}), the agent optimises its policy by aiming at lowering the total transition cost as soon as it meets the \ce{CO2} budget. The skewness of the cumulative emissions and costs in 2050 are indications of this reward function (see Table \ref{tab:skewness_gwp_cost}). When succeeding the transitions, the cumulative emissions have a negative skewness: the agent successfully stayed within the budget and most of the cases were close to that budget (median at 0.9 Gt$_{\ce{CO2},\text{eq}}$). On the contrary, the cumulative cost of successful transitions has a positive skewness: the agent successfully reduces the cost of the system as a secondary objective with 30\% of the cases above the reference transition cost. The hierarchy of the agent's objectives is verified with the failures. When it failed the transition, the agent aimed at reducing the emissions (skewness of 0.61) before minimising the total transition cost (skewness of 0.24). 

\begin{table}[htbp!]
\caption{Skewness of cumulative emissions and costs in 2050. Cumulative emissions are skewed to the left and to the right for the successes and failures, respectively. The skewness of the cumulative costs for successful transitions is higher compared to failures. On top of being the results of the optimisation through EnergyScope, these are influenced by the agent's policy that aims only at lowering the total transition cost as soon as it meets the \ce{CO2} budget.}
\label{tab:skewness_gwp_cost}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l c c}
\toprule
\textbf{Status of episode}  & \textbf{Skewness of cumulative} & \textbf{Skewness of cumulative} \\
\textbf{in 2050}  & \textbf{emissions} & \textbf{costs} \\	
\midrule
Success & -0.52 & 0.50 \\
Failure & 0.61 & 0.24 \\
\bottomrule							

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Finally, we observe that the majority of the successful transitions are cheaper than the reference transition cost, 1.1\,b€. Among the parameters impacting the most the total transition cost, we observe that success occurs when, on average,  the cost of purchasing fossil fuels is increased more than the one of electrofuels (see Table \ref{tab:param_RL}). In other words, to have higher chances to succeed a myopic transition, the key factor is to reduce the uncertainty on the cost of purchasing electrofuels or to increase the cost of fossil fuels. Given the skewness that is positive and negative for the electrofuels and the fossil fuels, respectively, these cases represent more than the majority of the successful cases. On top of this, total transition costs of successful episodes are lower due to lower industrial \gls*{EUD} and discount rates. These favourable conditions combined with the right agent's actions led to transitions respecting the \ce{CO2} budget.

\begin{table}[htbp!]
\caption{Uncertain parameters impacting the most the total transition cost and, for the successful transitions, the mean of their values between 0 and 100\%, $\mu$, and their skewness, $\gamma$. On top of being supported by the agent's actions, successful transitions occur when the cost of purchasing fossil fuels is more increased than the one of electrofuels.}
\label{tab:param_RL}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l c c c}
\toprule
\textbf{Parameter}  & \textbf{$\mu$} & \textbf{$\gamma$}  \\	
\midrule
Purchase electrofuels & 50.4\% & 0.004  \\
Industry EUD & 49.8\% & 0.026 \\
Discount rate & 48.4\% & 0.089\\
Purchase fossil fuels  & 55.0\% & -0.068\\
\bottomrule							

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Besides the cumulative emissions and costs, the agent also observes the share of renewable energy carriers in the primary mix and the efficiency of the system. The share of renewable energy carriers in the primary mix allows identifying intermediate milestones along successful transitions (see Figure \ref{fig:RE_in_mix_Efficiency}). From the initial state of 10\% in 2020, a boost of integration of renewables in the near term is needed to hope for a successful transition. For the successful occurrences to exceed failures, this share increases to 54\% in 2025. Along the transitions, this increase goes with the import of electrofuels and the full deployment of local \gls*{VRES}. In 2050, the threshold where successes occur more often than failures was at 82\% renewable share. In the REF case of Chapter \ref{chap:atom_mol}, this share reached 86\% by 2050. However, by 2050, Figure \ref{fig:RE_in_mix_Efficiency} shows another ``bump'' at lower shares of renewables in the mix. This area corresponds to the possibility of installing \gls*{SMR}. As uranium is considered as a non-renewable resource \cite{rixhon2021terminology}, installing \gls*{SMR} allows lowering the threshold as in the SMR case of Chapter \ref{chap:atom_mol}. Besides these milestones to respect the \ce{CO2} budget of the transition, one can also look at the other side of the thresholds. Below the near-term threshold of $\sim$60\%, this is the ``no-go zone'' where succeeding the transition becomes unlikely, except if betting on the future installation of \gls*{SMR}.

The efficiency, as defined in Section \ref{sec:RL:act_states_rew}, gives less valuable information towards successful transitions. Through the transition, besides the share of success increasing over the failures, the distributions of success and failure indistinguishably spread over the whole range. Similarly to the emissions, we observe a bump at lower efficiencies by 2050 due to the installation of \gls*{SMR}.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{RE_in_mix_Efficiency.pdf}
\caption{Exploration of the state space over the learning process: distribution of occurrence of share of renewable energy carriers in the primary energy mix (left) and efficiency (right).  The number of remaining attempts decreases with time since infeasible problems and solutions overshooting the \ce{CO2} budget are discarded prematurely, \ie before 2050. Besides infeasible problems, distributions labelled as ``Failure'' represent the attempts that overshot the \ce{CO2} budget by 2050 at the latest. Integration of local \gls*{VRES} at early stages then massive import of electrofuels later are needed to secure successful transitions. Below a near-term threshold ($\sim$60\%), the chances of success are limited, \ie no-go zones. Efficiency is less valuable information for the agent to succeed transitions as failures and successes indistinguishably spread over the whole range.}
\label{fig:RE_in_mix_Efficiency}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Actions}
\label{subsec:RL:learning:actions}

After investigating the intermediate milestones to meet the \ce{CO2} budget by 2050, this section details the actions the agent has taken during the learning process (see Figure \ref{fig:Actions_learning}). Rows represent the beginning of the time window at which the set of actions is taken. Similarly to the state space, we observe a wide exploration of the action space. The more the agent was able to progress through transition, without exceeding the \ce{CO2} budget, the bigger is the share of successes compared to failures. Besides this observation, no specific range of values for the different actions at the different timings seems to lead to more successes. Looking at action individually, there does not seem to be any that supports more effectively the transition. The success comes from the combination of these actions. 

After filtering out failures of the learning episodes and keeping only the successful transitions, only a limited set of the actions are binding and have an actual impact on the result of the optimisation in EnergyScope Pathway (see Figure \ref{fig:Binding_learning}). Supplementary Note \ref{subsec:binding} provides further details on the binding characteristic of a constraint. This allows identifying key actions to support the myopic transition. Limiting the \gls*{GWP} in the near term is a key factor for success. However, this action has a binding effect on the environment only at the end of the transition. The range over which limiting the use of fossil gas binds the optimisation is wider. Compared to other non-renewable fuels, this is due to the longer use of this energy carrier favoured by its low \gls*{GWP} (the second after uranium) and its versatility (applications in the electricity, heat and mobility sectors). In line with \citet{vogt2018starting}, the early constraints on generation and the sharper decrease of the emissions avoid lock-in situations.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Binding_learning.pdf}
\caption{Keeping only the successful transitions, distribution of occurrence of binding and not binding actions. Depending on the action and its timing, it is actually constraining the optimisation through EnergyScope Pathway or not. Sweet spots can be identified when considering the limits of \gls*{GWP} and fossil gas consumption. Limiting coal consumption is always constraining, unlike \gls*{LFO} which is ``naturally'' substituted by EnergyScope Pathway in the near term.}
\label{fig:Binding_learning}
\end{figure}

When it comes to limiting the use of \gls*{LFO} and coal, the conclusions are more straightforward. At the beginning of the transition, most of the 159\,TWh of \gls*{LFO} are consumed by naphtha-crackers (46\%) and decentralised boilers (45\%). The remaining 10\% are consumed by industrial boilers. Even though \gls*{LFO} represents  30\% of the primary energy mix in 2020, the cost-based model removes it from the mix without requiring the action of the agent. Naphtha-crackers, decentralised and industrial boilers get substituted by \gls*{MTO}, decentralised \gls*{HP} and industrial resistors and \gls*{CHP}, respectively.  This ``non-bindness'' of limiting \gls*{LFO} is an indication that this action could be removed from the agent's levers of action without impacting the optimisation of its policy.

On the contrary, limiting coal is always binding. Before all, this is due because coal is a cheap resource (17\,€/MWh). In other words, the cost-driven environment will favour it. Then, as the maximum amount of coal (28\,TWh) is much smaller than fossil gas and \gls*{LFO}, high values of $\mathrm{act}\textsubscript{coal}$ still represent small consumptions of coal. Whatever the stage in the transition, a policy limiting the use of coal will always be effective. However, to maximise the chance in succeeding the transition, the sooner the better.




\section*{DISCUSSION}

\acrfull{RL} was found to be an appropriate approach to explore myopic transition pathways under uncertainties and subject to \ce{CO2} budget over this transition. It also allows assessing the robustness of policies to support such pathways. 

Applying this method on a multi-cells model where regions can exchange energy carriers and materials, like Europe \ref{thiran2024exploring}, could provide insights into the varying effectiveness of energy policies applied to different energy systems. This extension could be done either by keeping a single agent ruling for the whole multi-cells system, similarly to the European Commission delivering directives to the Member States under the constraint of a collective \ce{CO2} budget. Or, that could be a multi-agent approach where each agent would have to interact with its own energy system and with the other agents, aiming at respecting their own \ce{CO2} budget. Even though a multi-agent environment is considerably more exigent \cite{perera2021applications}, this method would allow to highlight different individual national policies in the context of a collective objective to succeed the transition at a continental scale.

As a novice user of a \gls*{RL} framework considering continuous action and state spaces, we would recommend opting for \gls*{SAC} as it is sample efficient, ensures a wide exploration and has a low sensitivity to hyper-parameters \cite{haarnoja2018soft}. Using the \gls*{SAC} package developed by \textsc{Stable-Baselines3} allows a handy introduction to apply \gls*{RL}. 

Most of the work in applying \gls*{RL} is the definition of the interactions between the agent and its environment (\ie actions, reward and states) that are very dependent on the case study and the research questions to answer. The elements presented in this work result from several trials and errors to end up with meaningful results according to our research questions.

Besides mimicking potential actual policies, the actions chosen in this work have a direct translation into constraints and we can therefore assess their effectiveness through the fact they are binding or not. In this work, we have investigated other actions like incentivising solar \gls*{PV} panels and wind turbines by ``artificially'' reducing their \gls*{CAPEX}. The result is not conclusive as these technologies must take part in the Belgian energy transition and because it was harder to assess the actual impact of this action. 

The reward function was designed to first aim at respecting the \ce{CO2} budget and then minimising the total transition cost. The -300 penalty given in case of an infeasible optimisation problem was arbitrarily set. \textit{A posteriori}, it seems to be a well-defined penalty given its significant relative difference with the values taken by the reward otherwise, between -120 and 44 (see Figure \ref{fig:reward_status}). Besides this penalty and given the observed results, we recommend starting with the same reward function if the objective is similar, first target cumulative emissions then cumulative costs. This requires defining the \ce{CO2} budget according to a certain sharing principle (see Section \ref{sec:cs:CO2-budget}) and computing the reference total transition cost. However, other research focusing on reaching carbon neutrality by 2050 could define a binary reward function as +1 for reaching the objective and -1 otherwise.

Finally, states aim at representing the information relevant to the agent to efficiently learn and progress through the transitions. For this reason, on top of reward-related features (cumulative emissions and costs), we added other indicators that are actually monitored to help decision-makers assess their policies to reach their targets (share of renewables in the mix and the overall efficiency of the system). For other studies, one might consider other information like the metrics considered by \citet{pickering2022diversity} (\eg heat electrification, average national import or level of curtailment).

In conclusion, future studies might start from the actions-reward-states defined in this work and adapt these rules depending on the research questions to answer, the case study and the energy system optimisation model.

The discussion should explain the significance of the results and place them into a broader context. Subheadings are permitted.

\subsection*{Problem formulation and rules of the game}
Before starting an episode, a sample of uncertain parameters is drawn and affects the environment, EnergyScope Pathway, according to the methodology detailed in Section \ref{subsec:uncert_charac}. At the initial state, \ie the energy system in 2020, the agent gets an initial observation, $\bm{o}_0$. An observation represents a set of the characteristics of the environment accessible to the agent for it to take the next action. The state, though, is the exhaustive list of these characteristics. Even though an observation is a subset of the state, this work uses these two words interchangeably. From this state, the agent takes a step: action, reward,  and new state. The action, $\bm{a}_0$, impacts the environment, \ie the energy system limited transition over the first decision window (2020-2030). Through this interaction with its environment, the agent is given a reward, $r_1=r\left(\bm{a}_0 | \bm{o}_0 \right)$, and ends up in a new state, \ie the energy system in 2025, characterised by a new observation, $\bm{o}_1$, and so on (see Figure \ref{fig:Schematics_RL}).

A learning episode is a succession of such learning steps. In the context of the transition pathway between 2020 and 2050, an episode can come to an end for different reasons. First, if the actions taken by the agent make the optimisation infeasible, the episode is prematurely stopped before reaching 2050. Similarly, cumulative emissions of the system over the predefined \ce{CO2} budget (see Section \ref{sec:cs:CO2-budget}) lead to an anticipated end of the episode. Finally, the ``natural'' end is the prescribed end of the transition, \ie 2050. Consequently, the maximum value of steps for an episode is equal to $N=5$. 

The environment with which the \gls*{RL}-agent interacts is the optimisation of the transition pathway of a whole-energy system on a specific time window, \eg 2020-2030 then 2025-2035 and so on, until 2040-2050 (see Figure \ref{fig:Schematics_RL}). In a nutshell, starting from the initial state of the environment (\ie the whole-energy system in 2020), the agent takes a set of actions that influence the environment, \ie that affects parameters of the Linear Programming in EnergyScope Pathway. Then, the window 2020-2030 is optimised via EnergyScope. Some of the outputs of this optimisation feed the agent with either the new state of the system or the reward, \ie telling the agent how good the actions were at the state the agent took it. Based on the new state and the reward, the agent takes another set of actions and the window 2025-2035 is optimised. This goes on until 2050.

\subsubsection*{Actions}
\label{subsec:RL:act_states_rew:act}

Defining the levers of action, the core of the policy, to support the transition of a country-size whole-energy system is challenging, especially when accounting for political and socio-technical aspects \cite{castrejon2020making}. In our work, focusing only on the techno-economic aspect, we assume that the actions taken by the agent are directly implemented and impact the environment. In other words, considering only the techno-economic lens, there is no moderation nor contest towards the agent's actions, as the objective is to assess how far and when within the transition to push the different levers of action. Given the overall objective of the agent to succeed the transition, \ie respecting the \ce{CO2} budget by 2050, we have defined the actions in this sense. The first action, $\mathrm{act}_{\mathrm{gwp}} \in [0,1]$, aims at limiting the emissions at the representative year ending the concerned time window, $\textbf{GWP\textsubscript{tot}}(y_{\text{end of the window}})$, between the level of emissions in 2020, \ie $\textbf{GWP\textsubscript{tot}}(2020)=123\,\text{Mt}_{\ce{CO2},\text{eq}}$, and carbon neutrality:

\begingroup
\belowdisplayskip=2pt
\abovedisplayskip=2pt
\begin{flalign} 
\label{eq:RL:act_gwp}
&\textbf{GWP\textsubscript{tot}}(y_{\text{end of the window}})\leq \mathrm{act}_{\mathrm{gwp}} \cdot \textbf{GWP\textsubscript{tot}}(2020). &
\end{flalign}
\endgroup

\noindent
This action is equivalent to setting a national \ce{CO2} quota.

Three additional actions support the strict limitation of yearly emissions: limiting the consumption of oil, fossil gas and coal. Out of the total \gls*{GHG} emissions in Belgium in 2020, oil (\ie so-called ``\gls*{LFO}'' in the model) and fossil gas account for roughly 40\% and 31\%, respectively. In 2020, solid fossil fuels (\ie so-called ``coal'' in the model) is much less consumed than oil and gas: \ie 28\,TWh of solid fossil fuels versus 159 and 142\,TWh for oil and fossil gas, respectively. Even though its cost (17€/MWh) makes coal cost-competitive, it is a highly-emitting resource, 0.40\,kt$_{\ce{CO2},\text{eq}}$/GWh. For these reasons, three independent actions limit the consumption of these three fossil resources up to the level of consumption in 2020, $\textbf{Cons\textsubscript{fossil gas}}(2020)$, $\textbf{Cons\textsubscript{LFO}}(2020)$ and $\textbf{Cons\textsubscript{coal}}(2020)$,  over the entire concerned time window, except the first one as this year is the initial condition of the time window and cannot be optimised any more:

\begingroup
\belowdisplayskip=2pt
\abovedisplayskip=2pt
\begin{flalign} 
\label{eq:RL:act_NG}
&\textbf{Cons\textsubscript{fossil gas}}(y)\leq \mathrm{act}\textsubscript{fossil gas} \cdot \textbf{Cons\textsubscript{fossil gas}}(2020) & \forall y \in \text{time window}\\
\label{eq:RL:act_LFO}
&\textbf{Cons\textsubscript{LFO}}(y)\leq \mathrm{act}\textsubscript{LFO} \cdot \textbf{Cons\textsubscript{LFO}}(2020) & \forall y \in \text{time window}\\
\label{eq:RL:act_COAL}
&\textbf{Cons\textsubscript{coal}}(y)\leq \mathrm{act}\textsubscript{coal} \cdot \textbf{Cons\textsubscript{coal}}(2020) & \forall y \in \text{time window}
\end{flalign}
\endgroup

\noindent
where $\mathrm{act}\textsubscript{fossil gas}$, $\mathrm{act}\textsubscript{LFO}$ and $\mathrm{act}\textsubscript{coal}$ can take values between 0 and 1. These complete the action space of the agent, $A\in \mathbb{R}^4_{[0,1]}$ (see Figure \ref{fig:Schematic_actions}).

\begin{figure}[!htbp]

\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Schematic_actions.pdf}
\caption{Actions available to the decision-maker. Taken at the beginning of the time window to optimise (year $Y$), the four actions impact (i) the emissions of the system at the end of the time window (year $Y+10$) and, (ii-iv) the consumption of fossil gas, LFO and coal at years $Y+5$ and $Y+10$. Unlike the first action that sets a target for the end of the time window, the last three aim at limiting the consumption of these fossil resources over the whole time window.}
\label{fig:Schematic_actions}
\end{figure} 

\subsubsection*{Reward}
\label{subsec:RL:act_states_rew:rew}

When the reward is not properly defined, the agent may optimise its policy for an unintended objective, leading to undesired or suboptimal behaviour, \ie the so-called misalignment of the learning objective \cite{christiano2017deep}. Even worse, it can lead to reward hacking (or reward tampering) where the agent exploits loopholes in the reward function to achieve higher rewards without actually performing the desired task \cite{amodei2016concrete}. On the contrary, a proper definition of the reward function increases the sample efficiency, \ie requiring fewer episodes to converge to the optimal policy.  It also makes the policy more stable and able to withstand variations and uncertainties in the environment \cite{henderson2018deep}.

Through its maximisation of the expected return (see Section \ref{subsec:meth_RL_algo}), a \gls*{RL}-agent is as sensitive to positive reward, \ie the carrot, as negative reward, \ie the stick.  When the former encourages desired behaviours, the latter can be seen as a penalty or a punishment and discourages undesirable behaviours \cite{sutton2018reinforcement}. In our case, we have decided to combine these two approaches (see Figure \ref{fig:Reward}).

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Reward.pdf}
\caption{Reward function, $R$. Before 2050, the episode is prematurely ended and a negative reward is given if the optimisation is infeasible or if the \ce{CO2} budget is exceeded. If the optimisation provides a solution and the \ce{CO2} budget is not exceeded, the episode continues. Finally, if the episode goes until 2050, the reward is a weighted sum between the capped cumulative emissions and the total transition cost, and the episode terminates. After terminating an episode, the process starts over at the initial state, \ie 2020.}
\label{fig:Reward}
\end{figure} 

\newpage
The reward function is defined in three steps. First of all, taking a set of actions at a certain state might lead to an infeasible optimisation problem. In other words, as actions have a direct impact on some constraints of the problem, they might limit too much the feasible domain to the point where no solution can be found. For instance, the extreme case of aiming at carbon neutrality, \ie $\mathrm{act}_{\mathrm{gwp}}=0$, and forbidding the use of the three aforementioned fossil fuels, \ie $\mathrm{act}\textsubscript{fossil gas}=\mathrm{act}\textsubscript{LFO}=\mathrm{act}\textsubscript{coal}=0$,  from the beginning of the transition makes the optimisation impossible to solve. In this case, the episode is prematurely ended and the reward is ``highly'' negative, -300. If the optimisation is feasible and the end of the transition, \ie 2050, is not reached, the cumulative emissions so far are evaluated. On the one hand, if these cumulative emissions exceed the \ce{CO2} budget, $1.2\,\text{Gt}_{\ce{CO2},\text{eq}}$ (see Section \ref{sec:cs:CO2-budget}), the episode is also ended and a penalisation is given to the agent. This penalisation is proportional to the difference between the \ce{CO2} budget and the actual cumulative emissions.  On the other hand, the episode continues with a zero reward if the \ce{CO2} budget is not exceeded. Eventually, when reaching 2050, given the main objective of the agent to respect the \ce{CO2} budget and not to be more ``\ce{CO2}-ambitious'', we cut short the contribution of the cumulative emissions as soon as they are lower or equal to the \ce{CO2} budget.  On top of that, the reward function includes a secondary objective: the cumulative transition cost. To make the agent sensitive to the cost impact of its policy, we added the total transition cost in the reward function where the \emph{Trans. cost$_{\text{ref}}$} on Figure \ref{fig:Reward} is equal to $1.1\cdot10^3$\,b€. This value comes from the mean of the total transition costs obtained through the \gls*{GSA} performed on the perfect foresight transition pathway optimisation (see Section \ref{subsec:atom_mol:results_uq_cost}). In this final form of the reward, one will notice that overshooting cumulative emissions is more penalising than an overshooting transition cost, \ie a weight of 200 for the emissions versus 100 for the cost. The values of these weights are the results of a trial and error to fine-tune the balance between more expensive successes and cheaper failures. This way, we observed that the agent first targeted the respect of the \ce{CO2} budget and then, to a lesser scale, avoided reaching over-costly transitions.

\subsubsection*{States}
\label{subsec:RL:act_states_rew:states}

Besides the reward, the states are the other piece of information provided by the environment to the agent. In \gls*{RL}, the purpose of states is to represent the current situation or configuration of the environment in which the agent operates. The primary function of states in RL is to provide the necessary context for the agent to choose appropriate actions based on its current observations and goals \cite{sutton2018reinforcement}. The challenge in the definition of the states is to provide enough information but not too much to avoid overwhelming the agent with non-informative features. 

Consequently, after testing several state spaces and observing the convergence of the reward, we have converged to a four-dimensional state space characterizing the energy system at the end of the optimised time window. The first dimension is directly related to the main objective of the agent: respecting the \ce{CO2} budget until 2050. Therefore, the cumulative emissions emitted so far up to the current step of the transition is the first dimension of the states. Similarly, the cumulative cost of the transition so far constitutes the second dimension of the states to inform the agent about the cost-impact of its actions on the environment. Finally, to enrich the level of details, we have added two other dimensions representative of the key-to-the-transition indicators identified in the Renewable Energy Directive (RED) III of the European Commission \cite{REDIII}: the share of renewables in the primary energy mix and, the energy efficiency. The former is computed as the share of local renewables (\ie wind, solar, hydro and biomass) and imported renewable energy carriers (\ie biofuels and electrofuels) in the total consumption of primary energy. Electricity imported from abroad is not considered in the set of renewable energy carriers even if it can be assumed to be fully renewable by 2050. Finally, even though energy efficiency is usually defined as the ratio between the \gls*{FEC} and the primary energy mix, we decided to define this efficiency with a focus on the \gls*{EUD}, like in the rest of this thesis. Where electricity, heat and non-energy \gls*{EUD} are expressed in terms of energy content, we needed to convert passenger and freight transports into their respective \gls*{FEC} to integrate them in the ratio. The information of efficiency fed back by the environment to the agent is the ratio between a ``hybrid'' \gls*{EUD} and the consumption of primary energy resources.
